# Early prediction of Failure Temperature of PMS Motor

Title : Permanent magnet synchronous Motor temperature prediction

 Business Requirement :
Early prediction of Failure Temperature of PMS Motor
which is critical for (a) Maintaining rotation speed, (b) Maintain magnet health in the stator of motor

 Conclusion :
Built a model which takes all input sensor data as input, and find if rotor temperature is at safe limit Model worked great with Random forest, and deployed with streamlit
